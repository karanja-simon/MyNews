      Four Seasons, not a name normally associated with the casual fare food 
      trucks are known for, kicked off its second annual food truck tour 
      earlier this month. Visiting nine cities along the East Coast between 
      September and November, &quot;Taste&quot; by Four Seasons will serve up local eats 
      in its host cities: Think lobster rolls in Boston and pastrami sliders 
      in New York City.
