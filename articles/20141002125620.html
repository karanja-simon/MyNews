      My first lesson when I visited Norfolk? How to pronounce it. Call it 
      Nor-fok, or better yet, Naw-fok. But don???t call it Nor-folk. No matter 
      how you say it, though, this truly is one of the great historic cities 
      in America. Travelers will find nearly 150 miles of sweeping coastline 
      here, a thriving arts scene and world-class cuisine. Here are a few 
      attractions not to miss.
